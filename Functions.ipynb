        "  -  Function: A standalone block of code that can be called independently. It is not associated with any particular object or class.\n",
        "\n",
        " Method: A block of code that is part of a class and is associated with an instance of that class. It has access to the instance's attributes and can modify its state\n",

        " 2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "   - In Python, parameters are the variables defined in a function's definition, while arguments are the values passed to the function when it's called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Defined in the function definition: Parameters are specified in the function definition and are used to receive the values passed to the function.\n",
        "2. Variables: Parameters are variables that are local to the function and can be used within the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Passed to the function: Arguments are the values passed to the function when it's called.\n",
        "2. Assigned to parameters: When a function is called, the arguments are assigned to the corresponding parameters\n",

        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "  - ython provides several ways to define and call functions. Here are some of the most common methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Simple function definition: def function_name(parameters):\n",
        "2. Function with default arguments: def function_name(parameter=default_value):\n",
        "3. Function with variable-length arguments: def function_name(*args) or def function_name(**kwargs)\n",
        "4. Lambda function: function_name = lambda parameters: expression\n",

        "  -\n",
        "The return statement in a Python function is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Exit the function: When a return statement is encountered, the function execution is stopped, and control is passed back to the caller.\n",
        "2. Return a value: The return statement can specify a value to be returned to the caller, which can then be used in the calling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",

        "  - In Python, iterables and iterators are two related but distinct concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterables\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Objects that can be iterated: Iterables are objects that can be iterated over, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
        "2. Can be looped over: Iterables can be looped over using a for loop or other iteration constructs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterators\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Objects that keep track of iteration state: Iterators are objects that keep track of the current position in an iterable and can be used to retrieve the next item.\n",
        "2. Return items one at a time: Iterators return items one at a time, allowing for efficient iteration over large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined .\n",
        "  - In Python, generators are a type of iterable that can be used to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly, rather than storing them all in memory at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Generators Work\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Defined using functions: Generators are defined using functions that contain the yield keyword.\n",
        "2. Yield values: When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator that yields values one at a time.\n",
        "3. State is preserved: The generator function remembers its state between calls to next(), allowing it to pick up where it left off.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "  -\n",
        "Generators have several advantages over regular functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Memory Efficiency: Generators use less memory because they only generate values as needed, rather than storing all values in memory at once.\n",
        "2. Lazy Evaluation: Generators only evaluate the next value when requested, which can improve performance and reduce unnecessary computation.\n",
        "3. Flexibility: Generators can be used to implement complex iteration logic and can be easily composed together.\n",
        "4. Improved Performance: Generators can improve performance by avoiding the need to store large datasets in memory and by reducing unnecessary computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used ?\n",
        "  - A lambda function, also known as an anonymous function, is a small, one-line function that can be defined inline within a larger expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax\n",

        "The syntax for a lambda function is:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Lambda functions are typically used:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. One-time use: When a function is only needed once, a lambda function can be defined inline.\n",
        "2. Simple operations: Lambda functions are suitable for simple operations that don't require complex logic.\n",
        "3. Higher-order functions: Lambda functions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions, such as map(), filter(), and reduce().\n",

        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
        "  - purpose of the map() Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a map object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax\n",
        "\n",

        "10.  What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "  -  The map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python are three important functions that can be used to process iterables. Here's a brief overview of each function:\n",

        "1. Applies a function: map() applies a given function to each item of an iterable.\n",

        "3. Use case: Use map() when you need to apply a transformation to each item of an iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "filter() Function\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Filters items: filter() filters items from an iterable based on a given function.\n",
        "2. Returns a filter object: filter() returns a filter object, which is an iterator.\n",
        "3. Use case: Use filter() when you need to select a subset of items from an iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "reduce() Function\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Applies a function cumulatively: reduce() applies a given function cumulatively to the items of an iterable.\n",
        "2. Returns a single value: reduce() returns a single value, which is the result of the cumulative application of the function.\n",
        "3. Use case: Use reduce() when you need to compute a single value from an iterable.\n",
